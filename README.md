# Password-Complexity-and-Security-Report
Password complexity is critical for securityâ€”short or simple passwords are easily cracked by brute force and dictionary attacks, while long, random, and unique passwords are much harder to compromise. Testing with password strength checkers shows that using 12+ characters, mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding common words or patterns dramatically improves protection. Common attacks like credential stuffing and phishing exploit weak or reused passwords, so always use strong, unique passwords for every account and consider a password manager for safe storage.
